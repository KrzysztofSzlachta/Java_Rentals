# Rentals - a backend web application.

Project was created using Java, Spring Boot and Hibernate framework to simulate a rental website. It connects to a PostgreSQL database with three tables: clients, items and reservations.

Functionalities:
- adding, editing and deleting a client, item and reservation
- correct error returning
- safemeasures against inserting data duplicates and wrong formats

In progress:
- searching for reservations based on (partial) name or surname of a person
- searching for reservations based on (partial) name or type of item
